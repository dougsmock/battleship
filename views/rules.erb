<h4>Welcome to Doug Smock's version of Battleship, the iconic board game that has been popular for decades."</h4>

<h4>"Directions: Choose a grid, smaller (12x12), larger (24x24) and huge (36x36). Place your ships as directed, staying within the grid."</h4>

<h4>"After placing your ships, begin firing! A blue square means a miss and a red square equals a hit. Your enemy is randomly firing at your ships, so be accurate! Advice: Do not waste a move by hitting a colored square; it will be a wasted move."</h4>

<h4>"If you sink all four of your enemy's ships (14 hits in all), you win!"</h4>
